## Introduction
The method to extract the top 1000 records from any table and output them to a csv file is contained in this Jupyter notebook file.
To upload the ipynb file to your Jupyter notebook, just download it. There are two different ways to build a function and show the top 1000 records together.

# Method 1
The first method creates a Python engine to receive data from a SQL table and returns the top 1000 rows of the table for the column channeltype distribution2.

# Method 2
The top 1000 rows are selected and written into a new csv file using this method, which reads data directly from a csv file.
